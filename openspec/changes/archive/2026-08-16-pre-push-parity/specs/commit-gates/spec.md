# commit-gates — delta spec

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The pre-push hook runs the gates named here

The pre-push hook SHALL run, in addition to the type check and `bun test`:
`biome ci`, the YAML syntax check, the suppression scan, and the mutation
floor with the Stryker run that produces its report. A non-zero exit from any
of them SHALL block the push. The diff budget SHALL remain the single
exception, absorbed as `change-slicing` requires, because it measures rather
than judges.

No specification under `openspec/specs/` other than this one SHALL enumerate
what the hook runs. The list was previously spread across four of them, two of
which disagreed, and a gate no single file claims is one a change can break
without contradicting anything. A change's own artefacts and `README.md` may
name individual checks and SHALL link here for the list.

A check whose tool may be absent from a developer's machine — `actionlint` over
`.github/workflows/`, `gitleaks` over the commits the push would add — SHALL be
guarded by
`command -v` and SHALL be skipped silently when the binary is not on `PATH`, so
a fresh clone can push. Absence SHALL NOT fail the hook: CI runs both from
pinned versions, and that is where their verdict is binding. Presence SHALL be
treated like any other gate — a non-zero exit blocks the push, because a
finding a developer can see before pushing is one they should not push past.

The hook SHALL NOT run the browser suite or the coverage report — `smoke-suite`
owns why for both — nor `bun audit`, which queries an advisory database over
the network and would make an offline push fail on a gate about published
vulnerabilities rather than about the branch. CI runs it on a pull request that
touches `package.json`, and nightly.

#### Scenario: A gate that CI would fail blocks the push instead

- **WHEN** a branch is pushed whose surviving-mutant count exceeds the floor
- **THEN** the hook reports the count and the floor and exits non-zero, and the
  push does not happen

#### Scenario: A tool the machine does not have

- **WHEN** `actionlint` is not on `PATH` and a branch is pushed
- **THEN** the hook completes without error and without linting the workflows

The secret scan SHALL be bounded to the checked-out branch's range —
`--log-opts` from the base branch to `HEAD`, resolved as
`scripts/diff-budget.sh` resolves its own base — and SHALL NOT walk the whole
history the way CI does. Two failure modes decide the bound: an unbounded scan
means one secret ever reaching history blocks every push by everyone until a
baseline is written, and a working-tree scan reads the gitignored files that
exist for one author and in no clone.

`HEAD` is the supported push shape, and the hook SHALL NOT be read as covering
more. It does not consume the ref-update records git writes to a pre-push
hook's standard input, so a push of some ref other than the checked-out one
leaves its commits unscanned here. That is the same gap as a machine without
`gitleaks`, and it closes the same way: CI keeps the history-wide scan, where a
failure stops one pull request rather than everybody's pushes, and that is
where the verdict is binding.

#### Scenario: A tool the machine has, reporting a finding

- **WHEN** `gitleaks` is on `PATH` and the branch carries a recognisable API
  token
- **THEN** the hook exits non-zero and the push does not happen

#### Scenario: A secret that is already in the base branch

- **WHEN** `gitleaks` is on `PATH` and a recognisable token sits in a commit
  the branch did not add
- **THEN** the hook does not report it, because the scan is bounded to the
  range the push would send; CI's history-wide scan is what owns that case

#### Scenario: The budget is still soft

- **WHEN** a branch at 950 counted lines is pushed and every other gate passes
- **THEN** the hook prints the `FAIL` gate line and the push proceeds

#### Scenario: The list has one home

- **WHEN** a file under `openspec/specs/` other than this one enumerates what
  the pre-push hook runs
- **THEN** the change is rejected at review — the fragment belongs here, and
  the other specification states only the part it owns
