# commit-gates — delta spec

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The pre-push hook runs every gate that needs no browser

The pre-push hook SHALL run, in addition to the type check and `bun test`:
`biome ci`, the YAML syntax check, the suppression scan, and the mutation
floor with the Stryker run that produces its report. A non-zero exit from any
of them SHALL block the push. The diff budget SHALL remain the single
exception, absorbed as `change-slicing` requires, because it measures rather
than judges.

No specification under `openspec/specs/` other than this one SHALL enumerate
what the hook runs. The list was previously spread across four of them, two of
which disagreed, and a gate no single file claims is one a change can break
without contradicting anything. A change's own artefacts and `README.md` may
name individual checks and SHALL link here for the list.

A check whose tool may be absent from a developer's machine — `actionlint` over
`.github/workflows/`, `gitleaks` over the working tree — SHALL be guarded by
`command -v` and SHALL be skipped silently when the binary is not on `PATH`, so
a fresh clone can push. Absence SHALL NOT fail the hook: CI runs both from
pinned versions, and that is where their verdict is binding. Presence SHALL be
treated like any other gate — a non-zero exit blocks the push, because a
finding a developer can see before pushing is one they should not push past.

The hook SHALL NOT run the browser suite or the coverage report. `smoke-suite`
owns why for both.

#### Scenario: A gate that CI would fail blocks the push instead

- **WHEN** a branch is pushed whose surviving-mutant count exceeds the floor
- **THEN** the hook reports the count and the floor and exits non-zero, and the
  push does not happen

#### Scenario: A tool the machine does not have

- **WHEN** `actionlint` is not on `PATH` and a branch is pushed
- **THEN** the hook completes without error and without linting the workflows

#### Scenario: A tool the machine has, reporting a finding

- **WHEN** `gitleaks` is on `PATH` and the branch carries a recognisable API
  token
- **THEN** the hook exits non-zero and the push does not happen

#### Scenario: The budget is still soft

- **WHEN** a branch at 950 counted lines is pushed and every other gate passes
- **THEN** the hook prints the `FAIL` gate line and the push proceeds

#### Scenario: The list has one home

- **WHEN** a file under `openspec/specs/` other than this one enumerates what
  the pre-push hook runs
- **THEN** the change is rejected at review — the fragment belongs here, and
  the other specification states only the part it owns
